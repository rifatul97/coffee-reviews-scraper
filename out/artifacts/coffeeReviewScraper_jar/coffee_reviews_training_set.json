It is a washed or wet-processed coffee, meaning both skin and fruit flesh were removed from the beans before drying, a practice that generally intensifies acidity and clarity of flavor. Willoughby’s Coffee \u0026 Tea is a pioneer specialty coffee roaster established in the early 1980s that has gracefully and successfully moved with the times and now offers a menu of extremely refined small-lot, single-origin coffees. Visit www.willoughbyscoffee.com or call 800-388-8400 for more information.",
  "Summary": "A Pacamara on steroids, in the best possible sense, with butterscotch and lavender, in particular, in 3-D."

This sample also consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans.

Processed by the “natural” method, in which the coffee is dried inside the whole fruit, rather than by the more orthodox “washed” method, in which the soft fruit residue is removed before the beans are dried. Available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. (Orders must be received by December 11.)

Until recently Toarco sold its entire production to the Japanese market, making this coffee rare in the United States. Toarco exports both conventionally wet-processed coffee and coffee processed by the Indonesian wet-hulled method; this sample represents the latter. Big Shoulders Coffee is a Chicago artisan roaster that emphasizes a fresh-roasted, no-nonsense approach to fine coffee. Visit www.bigshoulderscoffee.com or call 312-888-3042 for more information.",
  "Summary": "Elegantly exotic and bold. Should appeal to those who enjoy rich, flavor-saturated, deeply nuanced coffees."

  "Notes": "Comprised entirely of beans from the rare Sudan Rume, a presumably very old variety of Arabica originally selected from wild trees growing on the Boma Plateau of Sudan, close to the border with Ethiopia. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Produced by farmer Rigoberto Herrera at Granja La Esperanza in Colombia, an innovative producer that specializes in impressive and innovative work with unusual cultivars of Arabica.

  "Notes": "Produced by smallholding farmers from the Onang Ganjang cultivar, a cross between the Hibrido de Timor and Ateng varieties of Arabica. Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a refined example of the type.

Most Yirgacheffe coffee is prepared by the conventional wet method, in which the skin and pulp are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried, encouraging a cleanly high-toned, often intensely floral- and citrus-toned cup. This Yirgacheffe is a “natural” or dry-processed version, however, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a deeper-toned profile, more pungent than bright, though still extravagant in its aromatics. This striking coffee was developed and brought into the U.S. by boutique exporter/importer Ninety Plus Coffee. Roasting Room is a quality-focused roaster in Taiwan.

  "Notes": "Despite challenges ranging from unclear government coffee policy and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands to chronically unstable weather, the famed Kenya coffee auction system and its participating cooperatives continue to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Mojo Coffee is a New Orleans-based roaster specializing in ethically sourced, hand-sorted and small-batch-roasted coffees. It strives to highlight the innate sweetness and unique flavor characteristics of each coffee and focuses on ensuring consistency from seed to cup.

  "Notes": "Produced from the Maracaturra coffee variety, a cross between the compact-growing Caturra (itself a mutant of the heirloom Bourbon) and the rare, huge-beaned Maragogipe, making it a parallel variety to the better-known Pacamara, a cross between Maragogipe and Pacas (also a mutant selection of Bourbon). Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin.

  "Notes": "Most Yirgacheffe coffee is prepared by the conventional wet method, in which the skin and pulp are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried, encouraging a cleanly high-toned, often intensely floral- and citrus-toned cup. This Yirgacheffe is a “natural” or dry-processed version, however, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a deeper-toned profile, more pungent than bright, though still extravagant in its aromatics. This striking coffee was developed and brought into the U.S. by boutique exporter/importer Ninety Plus Coffee. Turning Point Coffee coffee began with a personal obsession with drinking the best coffees on Earth. Each coffee is micro-roasted to order, allowing for an intense focus on the quality and consistency of the product. Located in the San Francisco neighborhood of Inner Richmond, Turning Point not only provides uncompromising quality, but also a personal relationship with their friends and neighbors.

  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: Not a classic espresso but an extremely fine one; the fudgy chocolate is traditional but the bright, complex, exhilarating fruit is strictly in the new American mode."

  "Notes": "This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 27 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2015. The Gakui wet mill is part of the Gakundu Farmers Cooperative Society, which consists of four wet mills in total. Produced from trees of the admired heirloom SL28 and SL34 varieties of Arabica, as well as the hybrid Ruiru 11. Despite challenges ranging from unclear government coffee policy and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands to chronically unstable weather, the famed Kenya coffee auction system and its participating cooperatives continue to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Giv COFFEE is dedicated to three goals: to provide quality coffee, to provide a fair price to farmers, and to give back to those in need. Giv COFFEE donates two dollars of every retail bag of coffee it sells; in the case of this coffee, the donation goes to support agricultural improvement projects in Africa.

A vibrant but unobtrusive acidity shimmers in the heart of the sweetness; mouthfeel is satiny, full, almost nectar-like. Flavor, particularly the crisper notes, carries deep into a sweet, peachy finish.",
  "Notes": "This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 1 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2015. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety “Gesha” or “Geisha” grown by coffee expert and educator Willem Boot and associates on his La Mula farm in Panama. With its elongated beans and distinctive floral and chocolate cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. The striking character of the Gesha variety is complicated in this version by an unusual variation in processing: maceration or softening of the ripe coffee fruit through soaking in slightly heated water before fruit removal, which appears to encourage a hint of fermentation and intensifies the already intense character of the Gesha profile. JBC Coffee Roasters was founded in 1994 as Johnson Brothers Coffee Roasters and is a family-owned specialty coffee roastery located in Madison, Wisconsin. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.

Vanilla, musk and rose in particular carry into a finish that, as it lengthens, continues to modulate and surprise.",

  "Notes": "Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Yirgacheffe coffees like this one processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying) typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on floral notes. Like virtually all Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops.

Note that most of the rest of the Starbucks Reserve coffees, including all of those that can be purchased online or off-site, are roasted on a considerably larger batch-roaster located on the lower level of the Reserve Roastery, and based on our sampling are roasted considerably darker than the highest-end coffees like this one that are only sold scooped out of bulk bins on location. For further information visit www.starbucks.com/roastery.",

Unfortunately, short of traveling to Seattle and buying this blend in person at the new Starbucks Reserve Roastery readers apparently will have no way to decide for themselves whether Starbucks split the difference felicitously between dark and medium when it roasted this blend. The Starbucks Reserve coffees sold online or off-site are roasted much darker than this blend. Nice coffees, fancy names, but, well, just your same old dark-roasted Starbucks."

Produced in tiny, coddled lots, it is an ultimately refined dry-processed or \"natural\" coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or \"washed\" coffees.

With its elongated beans and distinctive floral and chocolate cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. The striking character of the Gesha variety is complicated in this version by an unusual variation in processing: maceration or softening of the ripe coffee fruit through soaking in slightly heated water before fruit removal, which appears to encourage a hint of fermentation and intensifies the already intense character of the Gesha profile. JBC Coffee Roasters was founded in 1994 as Johnson Brothers Coffee Roasters and is a family-owned specialty coffee roastery located in Madison, Wisconsin.

  "Notes": "Despite grower discontent and urban encroachment on prime producing areas, Kenya cooperatives continue to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees. This particular Kenya is produced by members of the Mutheka Farmers Cooperative Society; Kaiguri is one of seven wet-mills operated by the cooperative. From trees of the admired heirloom SL28 and SL34 varieties as well as the hybrid Ruiru 11. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Chocolate Fish is a distinguished New-Zealand-inspired micro-roaster based in Sacramento California, focused on the best in both quality and integrity.Visit www.chocolatefishcoffee.com or call 916-451-5181 for more information.",

  "Notes": "The unpredictability of coffee is confirmed once again with this striking sample, produced from trees that are apparently a spontaneous hybrid involving the famous Gesha (also Geisha) variety of Arabica. The producers Granja la Esperanza brought Gesha plant material from Panama, where this celebrated variety was first rediscovered, to Colombia, where they established it on their farm Cerro Azul. Some of the trees proved not to resemble the trees of the classic Gesha, however; they grew smaller and denser. The producers have given the name “Enano” or dwarf to this apparent hybrid of Gesha. Based on the slim evidence of the two samples of the Enano we have tested at Coffee Review, the result in the cup is a profile similar to the finest examples of bonafide Gesha, though perhaps a bit less intense in its Geshaness. Founded in 1995, Equator Coffees \u0026 Teas is a women-owned wholesale coffee roasting company with web-based retail and two recently-established cafés plus more on the way. Equator focuses on sustainability in coffee sourcing and business practices. Visit www.equatorcoffees.com or call 800-809-7687 for more information.",
  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: Some may prefer this quieter version of the Gesha cup; still exotic and complex, but a bit more chocolate, fewer flowers, less forward acidity. And for a coffee this distinguished and this close in expression to the famous and rare Gesha, an excellent value: in other words, quite a bit of Geshaness for relatively little money."

Bacca Café is a Taiwanese family-owned small café that roasts its own coffee and bakes its own pastries with sustained respect for the quality and provenance of green coffees and bakery ingredients.

  "Notes": "Coffee was first planted in Indonesia (in Java) in 1696. The coffee comprising this sample is purportedly the progeny of a later importation of coffee seed to Indonesia in about 1928, supposedly directly from Ethiopia (previously Abyssinia). To our eye and palate, this coffee does not much resemble Ethiopian cultivars in bean shape or cup profile, though it is a subtly unusual cup, especially in respect to a lush, lily-like floral note. Like all traditional Sumatras, it is a wet-hulled coffee, which process most likely gives it its underlying cedary, bittersweet, pipe-tobacco-like character. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot coffees and espressos from Hawaii and other premier coffee growing regions. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.",

  "BlindReview": "Unusual taste structure: a candyish sweetness is complicated by a richly sour sensation and a hint of savory depth. The richly and sweetly sourish sensation is most prominent in the acidity. Lightly syrupy, lively mouthfeel. In the aroma and flavor minty chocolate, lavender, a hint of strawberry, plum perhaps. The chocolate note carries into a very sweet, gently tart finish. We deducted one point from our original 91 rating owing to mildly uneven cups.",
  "Notes": "In the 1990\u0027s a coffee-breeding program was initiated by the Hawaii Agricultural Research Center aimed at creating unique, truly Hawaiian coffee varieties. The Pohihiu variety that composes this sample, a hybrid of the exotic Mokka variety established in Maui and the mainstream Typica, is one of the outcomes from this breeding work. Very little of this variety was produced this crop year and Daylight Mind is one of only two roasters to present this unusual coffee from Oahu’s Waialua Estate. Daylight Mind’s co-founder, coffee scholar Shawn Steiman, has a long and close relationship with Waialua Estate. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Waialua Estate, located on the North Shore of the island of Oahu, is one of four mechanically harvested farms in Hawai‘i. Visit www.daylightmind.com or call 808.339.7824 for more information.",
  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: Curious aficionados and those who value the quietly exotic. We puzzled over the odd sweet/sour/savory structure of this coffee when we cupped it blind. Such complications can be generated by serendipitous accidents of fruit removal and drying. We hope, however, that they are related to botanical variety, since this sample was produced from trees of a rare and unusual hybrid developed by Hawaii-based scientist Chifumi Nagai that combines the distinctive-tasting Mokka variety, probably originally from Yemen or Ethiopia via Brazil, and a sturdy local strain of the classic Typica."

Gamo Gofa coffees like this one processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying) typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on floral notes. Like virtually all Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. Temple Coffee is a quality-focused retail and wholesale specialty roaster active in Sacramento, California since 2005. Committed to sourcing, roasting and brewing the finest coffees, Temple features coffee from distinguished single estates and cooperatives around the world.

  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: A very exciting coffee, pure but exotic. The subtly layered floral and fruit notes are lyric and original."

Round, quietly vibrant acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. Richly sweet, powerfully flavor-saturated finish.",
  "Notes": "This exceptional coffee was selected as the #2 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2014.  Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are admired for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type.

Visit www.birdrockcoffee.com or call 858-551-1707 for more information.",
  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: A Sumatra both refined and intense; those many lovers of the Sumatra type should not miss this one; purists who still remain suspicious of the type should find this example both familiar (the pungent fruit is almost Kenya-like) yet original: pipe tobacco, clay, richly fudgy chocolate."

  "Notes": "This exceptional coffee was selected as the #28 coffee in the Coffee Review Top 30 Coffees of 2014.  The unpredictability of coffee is confirmed once again with this striking sample, produced from trees that are apparently a spontaneous hybrid involving the famous Gesha (also Geisha) variety of Arabica. The producers Granja la Esperanza brought Gesha plant material from Panama, where this celebrated variety was first rediscovered, to Colombia, where they established it on their farm Cerro Azul. Some of the trees proved not to resemble the trees of the classic Gesha, however; they grew smaller and denser. The producers have given the name “Enano” or dwarf to this apparent hybrid of Gesha. Based on the slim evidence of this single sample of the Enano, the result in the cup is a profile similar to the finest examples of bonafide Gesha, though perhaps a bit less intense in its Geshaness. Founded in 1995, Equator Coffees \u0026 Teas is a women-owned wholesale coffee roasting company with web-based retail and two recently-established cafés plus more on the way.

A tightly layered, utterly pleasing fusion of lavender-like flowers, roasted cacao nib and a hint of blood orange carries with clarity and consistency from aroma through finish. Lyrical, animated acidity; light but silky, lively mouthfeel. The finish never seems to stop; the floral-cacao-citrus notes ring on and on.",
  "Notes": "This exceptional coffee was selected as the #25 coffee in the Coffee Review Top 30 Coffees of 2014.  Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha). Gesha was planted on the Granja La Esperanza farms as part of a ten-year project to improve coffee quality and to introduce new botanical varietals to Colombia; Cerro Azul is one of those farms. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and chocolate cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world\u0027s most unique coffees. Tony’s Coffee has been roasting in Bellingham, Washington since 1971. Visit www.tonyscoffee.com or call 800-448-8804 for more information.",

  "Notes": "A dry-processed or \"natural\" coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or \"washed\" coffees. Haraz is a celebrated coffee growing region in north-central Yemen, west of the capital of Sana\u0027a. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemeni coffee is still grown from ancient cultivars and sun-dried, usually on the roofs of stone houses. This particular Yemen is the result of a program aimed at improving the quality of this legendary coffee by drying on raised tables and processing only ripe fruit. CaféTaster is an aficionado nano-roaster of the style increasingly characteristic of East Asia countries like Taiwan and Korea, roasting very high-end coffees in very small volumes for a tiny clientele of passionate coffee enthusiasts, in the process selling coffee education as much as coffee itself. For more information, visit www.facebook.com/cafetaster or email roaster Jerry Huang at [email protected]",
  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: Those interested in the taste of history; I suspect this is about how the best of the “Mocha” coffees of Yemen tasted when they first arrived in Europe to establish coffee as a luxury beverage, though they were probably brought to a darker roast. Those who enjoy the more spicy-sweet, savory side of coffee may enjoy this selection regardless of history."

This practice contrasts to the more conventional wet or washed method, wherein both skin and pulp are removed from the beans before drying. CaféTaster is an aficionado nano-roaster of the style increasingly characteristic of East Asia countries like Taiwan and Korea, roasting very high-end coffees in very small volumes for a tiny clientele of passionate coffee enthusiasts, in the process selling coffee education as much as coffee itself.

  "Notes": "This exceptional coffee was selected as the #8 coffee in the Coffee Review Top 30 Coffees of 2013.

Gesha was planted on the Granja La Esperanza farms as part of a ten-year project to improve coffee quality and to introduce new botanical varietals to Colombia; Cerro Azul is one of those farms. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and chocolate cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world\u0027s most unique coffees.

Bean Fruit is a quality-oriented small-batch roaster based in Jackson, Mississippi, whose motto is, “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.” Galatians 5:22-23.

  "Notes": "Puna is the easternmost district of the Big Island of Hawaii, literally on the other side of the island from the far more famous Kona district. From a three-acre farm in Puna owned and operated by Kelleigh Stewart and Brandon von Damitz, who did just about everything related to this coffee, from pruning to roasting. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading.

  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: This would be a striking and unusual coffee from anywhere in the world, but it is a particular surprise coming from Hawaii, where sweetness and balance are the positive norm rather than the startling aromatic originality of this Puna peaberry."

The independent coffee growers receive over 50% of the profits of this unusual and pioneering venture.

The version reviewed here is comprised of beans that they have swallowed along with the fruit, and which are harvested from their feces.

  "BlindReview": "Amazingly and giddily sweet. Honey, lush night-blooming flowers and ripe orange in aroma and cup. Juicy, lyric acidity; syrupy mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates more than fades in a remarkably rich, honey-toned finish.",
  "Notes": "Rwanda\u0027s tremendous potential as fine coffee producer has only come to fruition over the past several years owing to generous support from international aid agencies, the specialty coffee community and the industry of its growers. Produced entirely from trees of the heirloom Bourbon variety and the Bourbon-related Jackson and Mibirizi cultivars, this lot comes from the Abakundakawa Cooperative. Although the words \"Fair Trade\" appear on the label of the attractive valve-topped can, judging by the absence of trademarked seal this coffee may not be certified Fair Trade by FairTrade USA (formerly TransFair USA). However, Wonderstate Coffee, formerly Kickapoo Coffee, is affiliated with the Fair Trade Federation, a membership (rather than certifying) organization devoted to \"providing fair wages and good employment opportunities to economically disadvantaged artisans and farmers worldwide.\" Wonderstate Coffee is an award-winning roaster based in rural Wisconsin known for their commitment to guaranteeing higher pay for farmers and being the country’s first 100% solar powered roastery. Visit wonderstatecoffee.com or call (608) 637-2022 for more information.",
  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: Certainly the sweetest, and probably the best, Rwanda we have sampled for some time. The sweetness is the natural kind, a deeply nuanced expression of orchard-like purity enriched by a tactfully caramelizing roast. You certainly don’t need sweetener for this one."

Rich, deep acidity; silky/syrupy mouthfeel. Impressively long, resonant finish.",
  "Notes": "Most Yirgacheffe coffee is prepared by the conventional wet method, in which the skin and pulp are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried, encouraging a cleanly high-toned, often intensely floral- and citrus-toned cup. This Yirgacheffe is a \"natural\" or dry-processed version, however, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a deeper-toned floral and fruit character. Like virtually all Ethiopia coffees, this striking and unusual coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. Marcheur Roaster is a boutique roastery based in Taipei, Taiwan. The founders, James and Janet, have been importing high-quality green coffees into Taiwan for years and this new roastery represents their further commitment to introducing fine coffees to Taiwanese consumers.

  "Notes": "Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are admired for their complex earth, fruit and aromatic wood notes that result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” This coffee is a particularly intense and particularly refined example of the type. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading.

  "BlindReview": "Richly structured coffee with an intense balance of sweet, bitter and tart tastes supporting complex aromatics: lavender-like flowers, pecan, fresh-cut fir, and most strikingly, an unusual fruit note simultaneously suggesting mango and melon. Rich, deep acidity; lively, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The complex fruit note in particular carries into a drying but sweet finish.",
  "Notes": "Most Yirgacheffe coffee is prepared by the conventional wet method, in which the skin and pulp are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried, encouraging a cleanly high-toned, often intensely floral- and citrus-toned cup. This Yirgacheffe is a \"natural\" or dry-processed version, however, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile more pungent than bright though still extravagant in its floral-toned aromatics. Like virtually all Ethiopia coffees, this striking and unusual coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. Seattle Coffee Works is a small-batch retail and wholesale roasting company, focused on quality and green coffee sourcing without compromise.

  "Notes": "Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha). With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world\u0027s most unique coffees. This Gesha was processed by the “honey” method, meaning the skin was removed from the coffee fruit immediately after picking but the beans or seeds were dried with at least some of the fruit pulp or “honey” still adhering to them. This practice contrasts to the more conventional wet or washed method, wherein both skin and pulp are removed from the beans before drying. In addition to his retail roasting operation Aroma Roast Coffees, Simon Hsieh also operates Soaring Phoenix Trading, a business focused on purposed-built commercial espresso blends and high quality single-origin coffees.

This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Like all Caribou coffees, this one is Rainforest Alliance certified, meaning it was produced following sustainable ecological and socio-economic criteria developed by the Sustainable Agricultural Network, a coalition of independent, environment-focused non-governmental organizations. It is one of Caribou’s Roastmaster Reserve coffees, special seasonal offerings. Caribou Coffee is a retail roasting chain based in the upper Middle West whose rather irreverent motto \"Life is short. Stay awake for it\" belies a serious approach to coffee.  Visit www.cariboucoffee.com or call 888-227-4268 for more information.",

Continued delicate but very complex in two parts milk, with both chocolate and fruit rounding and sweetening.",
  "Notes": "Maragogipe (Maragojipe in Spanish; also spelled Maragogype) is a rare botanical variety of Arabica famous for its huge beans. This Maragogipe apparently was processed by the “honey” method, meaning the skin was removed from the coffee fruit immediately after picking but the beans or seeds were dried with at least some of the fruit pulp or “honey” still adhering to them. This practice contrasts to the more conventional wet or washed method, wherein both skin and pulp are removed from the beans before drying. Although the big-beaned Maragogipe is not particularly admired for its cup character, this Kona honey version, skillfully roasted by Simon Hsieh, displays impressive character as a single-origin espresso. In addition to his retail roasting operation Aroma Roast Coffees, Simon Hsieh also operates Soaring Phoenix Trading, a business focused on purposed-built commercial espresso blends and high quality single-origin coffees.

The acidity is quiet, perhaps muted; the body is light though the mouthfeel hints at silkiness. Aromatics simplify in the cup, dampened by a slight woodiness. Fades very quickly to a mild astringency in the finish.",

  "BlindReview": "Sweet-toned and pungent in the nose, with composty, prune-like fruit and bitterish wood notes. Retains the fruit and wood hints in the cup, but turns more aggressively bitterish and sour. Thin, leanish mouthfeel. Heavily astringent in the finish.",
  "Notes": "Purchased pre-ground in an 11-ounce can at a Safeway supermarket in Northern California; 68 cents per dry ounce. All coffees in this blend are certified organically grown, making this product the only organic roast-and-ground coffee widely available in U.S. supermarkets. All indications suggest that this blend contains some coffees of the Robusta species.  Visit www.yuban.com or call 800-982-2649 for more information.",
  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: The organic seal is impressive even though the cup isn’t."

  "BlindReview": "Disappointing for a 100% Colombian Arabica, even a Colombia presented in a roast-and-ground, canned format. Woody aroma with some pruny sweetness. Flat acidity, leanish mouthfeel. In the cup the wood persists and the fruit turns composty and unpleasantly fermented. Flat, astringent finish.",
  "Notes": "Sold roast and ground in a 10.3-ounce can; 70 cents per ounce. Composed of 100% Arabica Colombia coffees. Folgers is a 160-year old coffee brand founded in San Francisco, acquired in 1963 by Procter \u0026 Gamble, and sold in 2008 to the J.M. Smucker company.  Visit www.folgers.com or call 800-937-9745 for more information.",
  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: A particularly bad dark-roasted Colombia at the tail end of a bad year for Colombias generally."

  "BlindReview": "Woody nut rounded by a cherryish, rather composty dark-chocolate sweetness. Muted, slightly bitterish acidity; lean but smooth mouthfeel. Some nut and chocolate carry into a heavyish, astringent finish.",
  "Notes": "Purchased pre-ground in an 11-ounce can at a Safeway supermarket in Northern California; 57 cents per dry ounce. All indications suggest that this blend contains a significant percentage of coffees of the Robusta species. Maxwell House is a brand of Kraft Foods.  Visit www.maxwellhouse.com for more information.",
  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: Least offensive of the canned Robusta-centered supermarket blends tested for our November 2011 cupping."

  "BlindReview": "Pleasant enough ultra-dark-roast character in the aroma: roundly charred cedar, anise, a hint of citrus. All carry into the cup, though they lose considerable intensity on the way. Lean mouthfeel. The charred cedar turns to charred board in a terminally empty, astringent finish.",
  "Notes": "Purchased pre-ground in a valve-bag at a Safeway supermarket; 92 cents per dry ounce. Composed of 100% Arabica coffees. This is an extremely dark-roasted coffee; about as dark as it is possible to roast a coffee.  Visit www.starbucks.com or call 800-782-7282 for more information.",
  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: Except in the aroma, provides little of the pungent, charred intensity buyers of this ultimately dark-roasted coffee type love. Locally produced French roasts are likely to deliver considerably more."

  "BlindReview": "Impressive aroma: dark chocolate, a hint of pungent, grapefruity citrus. Both fade in the cup and disappear entirely in a heavily astringent, roast-flattened finish. Lean, watery mouthfeel.",
  "Notes": "Purchased pre-ground in a sealed 12-ounce foil-laminated bag with one-way valve at a Safeway supermarket in northern California; 67 cents per dry ounce. Composed of 100% Arabica coffees.  Visit www.starbucks.com or call 800-782-7282 for more information.",
  "Summary": "Who Should Drink It: Once past the aroma not much here. A whole-bean version of this blend bought from a Starbucks store doubtless would maintain more of the initially pleasing aromatics."
